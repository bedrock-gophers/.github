life is stressing me out man, plus this fucker tbn managed to get a charge-back somhow, but I mean. It was only 450 bucks

I will be completely cutting myself out from the discord community, I do not want any more contact with anyone from the past

I have invited natsuri back, he may do whatever he wants with the org, if he accepts, I will be transfering ownership so this never happens again.
